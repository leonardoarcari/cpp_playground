# C++ Playground of Leonardo Arcari

This repository is a personal place to play around with C++ during my studying
activities. So feel free to look somewhere else, because only incomplete,
probabily broken pieces of C++ code can be found here.

Sorry for stealing you those valuable seconds that took you to go through this
useless README.
